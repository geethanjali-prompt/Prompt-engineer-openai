## 📘 Lesson 12: What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the skill of designing effective instructions (called "prompts") to guide an AI like ChatGPT. A good prompt tells the AI clearly what kind of answer we want, how long it should be, what style to follow, and other details.

This helps the AI give better, smarter answers.

📝 Example Prompt:
“Write a 100-word funny story about 
a cat who opens a bakery in Paris. Use emojis!” 🐱🥐🍰
